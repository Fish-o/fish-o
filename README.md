# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Conner, a Technical Computer Science student at U-Twente.
I love coding, designing weird and complex systems, and learning new things!

I've done a lot of web development (experienced with next.js/react and backend dev using graphql, oauth2, mongodb/postgress and node.js) but most of my current projects are small projects done in rust.


## Some of my cool projects:

### FishLang

A simple programming language and interpreter, built from scratch in Rust!

It has a tokenizer, parser and interpreter. It's build to be very adaptable and customizable, with heavy usage of Rust's match statement.

### Advent of Code 2022

My attempt at the 2022 advent of code, done in november 2023 as preperation of AoC 2023!

### Kaarten As A Service
~[WIP]~ [ABANDONED] A platform that enables users to create whatever card game they desire. 
It uses a scratch like interface to lets users create their own card games with simple logic blocks.
The scripting langauge is very powerful and should be usable to create anything from uno to petiance.
**All** logic is handled on the client, and it uses public private key cryptography to verify people's identity.

Repo: https://github.com/Fish-o/KaaS-frontend (the code is a bit messy)

### The VR Party League Site
A site which can be used to organize tournaments. 
It's hopelessly overengineered with Vercel's on-demand incremental static regeneration (that together with Next.js's page caching results in each page loading seemingly instant), a self set up clustered database, and a full oauth2 server

A playground for the backend can be found here: 
https://api.vrpartyleague.com/graphql go here obtain an api key (needed for certain mutations) https://vrpartyleague.com/giveMeMyApiKeyEvenThoughItsDangerous

Backend Repo: https://github.com/VR-Party-League/VRPLBackEnd (the code is beautiful, in my opinioin, especially the `resolvers`. The middleware i created myself)
