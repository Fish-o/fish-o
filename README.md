### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Im fish, obviously not my real name, but i value my privacy :)

I love coding, designing weird and complex systems, and learning new things.

Some cool projects ive worked on are:

A site which can be used to organize tournaments. 
It's hopelessly overengineered with Vercel's on-demand incremental static regeneration (that together with Next.js's page caching results in each page loading seemingly instant), a self set up clustered database, and a full oauth2 server
https://vrpartyleague.com/

[WIP] A platform that enables users to create whatever card game they desire. 
It uses a scratch like interface to lets users create their own card games with simple logic blocks.
The scripting langauge is very powerful and should be usable to create anything from uno to petiance.
**All** logic is handled on the client, and it used public private key cryptography to verify people's identity.
